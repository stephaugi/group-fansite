# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
We need communication and time commitment from each member in order to collaborate the best we can.

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*
We should discuss our plan before splitting up individual work. Some parts such as navigation bar and other shared elements should be worked on together.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*


Stephanie: I learn best by doing and researching the topic when I run into issues.
Divya: I learn best by talking through each w
ve and explore resources individually and share ideas how we will implement.
YanYi: I learn best by going through the requirements as a team, and make sure I am clear on what is the shared workload.
Riley: I learn best by taking my time to understand the objectives before diving into work.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Stephanie: I prefer to receive feedback by reviewing work together and discussing the benefits of using one approach over another.
Divya: End of the project , I will ask my team what I did good and what I might improve.
YanYi: by going through the codes step by step
Riley: Talking through work, having time between completing code and refactoring to let understanding of code sink in 

# One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
Divya : Talking through code and explaining better

Stephanie: I would like to improve skills in giving feedback in a considerate way and receiving feedback. I would also like us actively participate in collaboration instead of us doing everything independently.

Riley: Understanding not only my code, but my teammates' code and how I could incorporate code reviews into my development workflow.

YanYi: ask question if not sure on something at a early stage, instead of waiting to figure out on my own. 

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
We'll try to be available during coworking time and the time between morning/afternoon classes to work on the project together
