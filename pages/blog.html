                <p>
                    When I first moved to Seattle, I quickly realized how much I had taken the flavors of home for granted. Growing up, dishes like Cantonese-style steamed fish were a regular part of our family dinners. But here, far from my parents’ kitchen and the steady rhythm of weeknight meals, I found myself craving that comforting taste of home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I picked up the phone, called my parents, and asked for their advice; the kind that never makes it into written recipes. With their guidance, I set out to recreate this classic dish in my tiny Seattle kitchen. What I ended up with was more than just a meal; it was a piece of my heritage brought back to life through steam, soy, and memory.

                    When picking a fish to steam, you have two options, live fish and fresh fish at the market. If you can, live white fish is best! Otherwise, here are some tips to help you choose a fresh fish.
