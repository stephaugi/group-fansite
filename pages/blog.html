                When picking a fish to steam, you have two options, live fish and fresh fish at the market. If you can, live white fish is best! Otherwise, here are some tips to help you choose a fresh fish.

                    <p>
                        <li><b>Steam Setup:</b> Place the steam rack in a deep pan and fill with water until right below the top of the steam rack. Cover and heat on high.</li>
                        <li><b>Fish:</b> Place fish into the dish you'll be using for steaming.</li>
                        <li><b>Aromatics:</b> Cut your aromatics. Ginger is sliced, and julienned.</li>
                        <li><b>Steam Fish:</b> When the water in the steam pan is boiling, place the dish with the fish onto the steam rack and cover. Steam on high heat for 10-12 minutes depending on the size of the fish.</li>
                        <li><b>Stirfry aromatics:</b> While it is steaming, begin heating up 2 tbsp of oil. When hot, quickly toss in aromatics for a few seconds.</li>
                        <li><b>Arrange:</b> Once fish is done steaming, take it out, drain the liquid and place stirfried aromatics on top. If the fish finishes steaming sooner, turn off heat and leave covered</li>
                        <li><b>Done:</b> Drizzle soy sauce over the fish. Enjoy!</li>
